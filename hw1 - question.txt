Using the attached regression data, you are going to train a radial basis function (RBF) network with one input, one output and H Gaussian units/experts.

Part 1:
Try at least three different H values so one underfits, one
fits well and one overfits. Initialize using online k-means and then use 
gradient-descent. For each case, after convergence, plot the
p_h(RBF), weighted values w_h*p_h, and the overall output, together 
with the training data so that we can see how the fit is distributed 
over the hidden units.

Plot different values in different styles (dashed, dotted, etc) so
that they can be distinguished or plot them in different colors.

Part2:
Plot also training and validation errors as a function of H for the case given above; plot these using averages over at least 10 runs starting from different
random weights.

Instructions
Do NOT use a built-in function or an implementation from another source but implement it yourself!

This homework is due May 13, Thursday, 23:59.
This is a STRICT deadline and will NOT be extended in any case!

Submit a single PDF document including the following
a) results (plots),
b) a short report explaining what you did (e.g. how you have determined the spread values, 
which parameters did you use for clustering, etc.
c) discussions (compare the results in a comparative manner).
